about=Survey Helpline Pro is a unified QGIS plugin designed to streamline and automate spatial data processing tasks required across various survey-related projects. The plugin provides dedicated workflows for Survey & Land Records (SS&LR) and Panchayat Raj (SVAMITVA) departments, ensuring consistent, error-free, and standardized outputs at every stage of the project lifecycle. Its primary purpose is to reduce manual effort, eliminate repetitive GIS operations, and provide survey teams with fast, reliable, and uniform tools for shapefile processing, parcel management, and other survey-related GIS functions. SVAMITVA → Reprocess Shapefile (Merged Shapefile) This tool automates the regeneration of SVAMITVA project shapefiles by guiding the user through a structured processing sequence. The user selects the polygon layer and required parameters through a simple dialog box. On clicking Run, the tool performs a series of predefined operations—cleaning, validating, merging, fixing geometry, and regenerating the final standardized shapefile. This ensures that all survey parcels follow uniform structure, naming conventions, attribute standardization, and topological consistency across all villages and projects.
